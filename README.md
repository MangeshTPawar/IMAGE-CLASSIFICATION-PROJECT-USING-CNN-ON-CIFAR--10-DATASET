# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT-USING-CNN-ON-CIFAR--10-DATASET
##Introduction
This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CIFAR-10 is a standard benchmark dataset that contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, and animals. The goal is to classify these images accurately using a robust deep learning model.

##Features
Preprocessing of CIFAR-10 dataset with normalization and data augmentation.
Custom CNN architecture with dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Training and validation pipeline using TensorFlow/Keras.
Real-time testing with image predictions.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is publicly available and contains:

Training Set: 50,000 images.
Test Set: 10,000 images.
Each image belongs to one of 10 classes, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Proposed Methodology
System Design
The project pipeline includes the following steps:

Data preprocessing with normalization and augmentation.
Feature extraction using a deep CNN architecture.
Model training with optimization techniques (Adam optimizer, dropout, L2 regularization).
Model evaluation and visualization of performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Language: 
Python
### Deep Learning Framework: 
TensorFlow/Keras
### Visualization: 
Matplotlib, Seaborn
### Environment: 
Google Colab

## Results
The trained CNN achieved 76%+ accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set.
Performance improvements were achieved using techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and L2 regularization.
Visualization of training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) is included in the project.
